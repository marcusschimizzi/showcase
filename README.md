# Personal Website & Portfolio

My personal website and portfolio ([schimizzi.io](https://schimizzi.io)) written with NextJS & TailwindCSS.

I've gone through many iterations of my personal website, but this is what I've landed on for now (as of 2024). Feel free to poke around, suggest an improvement, and use it as inspiration for your own website. (Please don't copy as-is, because that's not cool.)
